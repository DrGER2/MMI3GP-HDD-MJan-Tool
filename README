QNX SD shell script to repartition a 60+ GB HDD/SDD device in a live MMI3GP system.

The script uses a new custom QNX 6.3.0 compiled binary (hdd-formatter-mjan) offered by "MJan" to write MMI3GP (HN+) partitions and format as QNX6 filesystem.

Extract the ZIP archive directly to a full-size SD card formatted as FAT32.

Edit the plain-text file run.sh with a Unix friendly text editor (vi, vim, Notepad++) and change line 6 from:

  ACTI_HDDPARTITION=N

to

  ACTI_HDDPARTITION=Y

Start the MMI3GP system and wait for all functions (NAV, CAR, MEDIA, TEL) to start fully.

Insert the SD card into an open SD slot.

Follow the screen prompts; when the script is finished, eject the SD card and inspect the plain text log file.

Reboot the system manually.

When the repartition/reformat is successful, you will need to restore the SSS (text to speech) data from the software release SD card separately.
